      <h3>Game-Theoretic Incentive Mechanism for Unbiased Federated Learning 
      </h3>
      <ul>
        
        <li>
          <p>Motivation: Incentive mechanism is crucial for federated learning (FL) when rational clients do not have the same interests in the global model as the server. However, due to system heterogeneity and limited budget, it is generally impractical for the server to incentivize all clients to participate in all training rounds (known as full participation). 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Approach: This project aims to propose a game-theoretic incentive mechanism for FL with randomized client participation, where the server adopts a customized pricing strategy that motivates different clients to join with different participation levels (probabilities) for obtaining an unbiased and high-performance model.
          </p>
